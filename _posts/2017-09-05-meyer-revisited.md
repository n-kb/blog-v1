_This is the write-up of a [talk I am due to give at the SciCAR conference](https://scicar17.sched.com/event/BTVW) in Dortmund on September 7, 2017._

The organizers of the conference asked me to prepare a talk called "Meyer Revisited". Philip Meyer is well-known in datajournalism circles. He was among the first ones to use the methods of social science for journalistic purposes - and it turned out to be a great idea. That was close to fifty years ago, so it might be time to take a modern look at the ground-breaking book Meyer wrote in the late 1960's and revamped in a new edition in 1991, _Precision Journalism_. 

To prepare this talk, I re-read Meyer's book. Long story short: the book's still good, but some of the assumptions Meyer made about the impact of datajournalism were wrong, and we need to address them.

### It's still fresh

OK, some chapters of the book clearly _are_ outdated. When Meyer lists spreadsheet software, for instance ("Lotus, SuperCalc, PC-Calc") or when he explains how data storage on magnetic tapes works<sup><a name='note_1' id='#note_1' class='note_anchor' href='#foot_1'>1</a></sup>, the book does feel antiquated.

Much of the non-technical parts are still useful. The workflow Meyer describes in his first chapter ("Collect, Store, Retrieve, Analyze, Reduce and Communicate data") is the one we teach in journalism schools today, though we now put much less emphasis on data storage, retrieval and reduction because computers let us store and sort data fairly easily. Meyer's concept of "models" remains very current, too. In a nutshell, he argues that the underlying assumptions about an issue define how data will be collected and, ultimately, what analyses we'll be able to do with the data. 

The importance of models was shown once again last month when Reuters published an investigation on people who died following a taser strike, to take just one example.<sup><a name='note_2' id='#note_2' class='note_anchor' href='#foot_2'>2</a></sup> Axon, the company that manufactures the stun guns, measured the issue in a certain way, which led to a tally of 24 deaths since the early 2000's. By changing the model, or the way the issue was measured, Reuters came to a total of 1005 deaths. The difference lies in how one decides that the taser _caused_ the death. It turns out that Axios tends to sue the coroners who write down "taser" as the cause of death.<sup><a name='note_3' id='#note_3' class='note_anchor' href='#foot_3'>3</a></sup> As a result, a tally based on causes of death will be very low. Reuters changed the model and came closer to the truth.

### Precision journalism meets academia

What I found most interesting in Meyer's book wasn't his advice on how to do datajournalism - that's still very good. More interesting are the assumptions he made when he wrote. Meyer expected precision journalism to be widely adopted because it allows journalists to advance towards the truth much more efficiently than anything else.<sup><a name='note_4' id='#note_4' class='note_anchor' href='#foot_4'>4</a></sup> In that, he is right. The scientific method is, by far, the most efficient way to produce factual truth. When it is replicable and falsifiable, a result obtained from datajournalism is much stronger and useful than a story that was obtained in another way. Compare that with a work that relies on anonymous sources or on a limited number of testimonies. Let's take a piece by Seymour Hersh, an American journalist and Pulitzer prize winner, as an example. Because it does not follow any scientific method, the article in which he claims that Osama Bin Laden was offered to the Americans by the Pakistani secret service<sup><a name='note_5' id='#note_5' class='note_anchor' href='#foot_5'>5</a></sup> can hardly be verified or replicated. As a result, whether Hersh is right or wrong is a matter of personal conviction. This kind of journalism might be good by many standards, but it does not bring us any closer to the truth. However, it helps us define new hypotheses or, as Meyer would say, find new models.

Meyer argued that precision journalism, because it was interested in factual truth and followed the scientific method, was bound to grow close to academia. In the 1991 version of the book, he pointed at the spread of classes in computer-assisted reporting in American journalism schools as proof that the alliance between the two was working.<sup><a name='note_6' id='#note_6' class='note_anchor' href='#foot_6'>6</a></sup>

At Journalism++, an agency for data-driven journalism that I co-founded and ran between 2011 and 2017, we tried several time to work with academics. It wasn't easy. The first roadblock was a different relation to time. As journalists, we try to publish rapidly, or to choose a publication date that will maximize impact (you don't publish a piece on snow-making in June). Academics have different time scales. They, too, need to be fast, in order to be the first ones to put their names on a keyword, thereby ensuring a lot of citations later on and an increased h-index. (The h index is a measure of their importance among their peers which can have a crucial role in their careers.) However, although an academic might rush to publish, the rush will last more than a year, during which she can refuse that the journalists publish anything on their joint research. What if another academic reads the articles and publishes a paper under her own name first?

Another roadblock when working with academics is the relationship to data. Because an academic needs to obtain a p-value under 0.01, she has a tendency to test lots of hypotheses under a single project. This, in turns, leads to the collection of _many_ data points for each entity in a sample. As journalists, we are interested in hypothesis testing, too, but we're more interested in user happiness. A happy user is a user who shares the project on Facebook, and this is, for many of us, the single biggest measure of success. When a user has to give 30 pieces of information about herself before seeing the product, she is definitely not happy. If you want to feel the difference between the two approaches, you can compare a dialect quiz we made for the Swiss public service broadcaster in 2015, the [Parlomètre](http://www.parlometre.ch/#!/), with [a similar project](https://uclpsychology.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_9RyEyvd4I7Lt1ul) done at the same time by a Swiss university.<sup><a name='note_7' id='#note_7' class='note_anchor' href='#foot_7'>7</a></sup>

### No love affair

I'm sure many of those who worked in joint projects between journalists and academics could come up with more stories. Of course, we could dismiss these as mere anecdotes, or we could consider such mishaps teething troubles that will be overcome as soon as both fields learn to collaborate.

Maybe that's what will happen. But still. Journalism and academia have lots of reasons to work together. The clout of a media brand could help academics recruit participants in a study. An academic could benefit from a journalist's skills to communicate a finding to the general public. Journalists working closely with academics would benefit from the possible scoops they might have when an experiment is completed. When it comes to looking for and communicating the truth, there are many objective reasons why journalists and academics should team up. 

This has not happened since Meyer published _Precision Journalism_ fifty years ago. I know of very few peer-reviewed articles co-authored by a journalist and a scientist, for instance.<sup><a name='note_8' id='#note_8' class='note_anchor' href='#foot_8'>8</a></sup> Or of a joint experiment where a newsroom played an active role. Or of a joint conference for both professions. Maybe the efforts of the Volkswagen Stiftung, a German non-profit (no relation to the criminal car maker<sup><a name='note_9' id='#note_9' class='note_anchor' href='#foot_9'>9</a></sup>), who organized the first conference of this kind in Europe, will bear fruits. However, the grants the foundation awarded, worth €100,000, cannot be said to be catalysts for a change in practices. They're a subsidy. In the current environment, both newsrooms and academics would do _anything_ for that kind of money.

### Changing the model

Maybe we could see clearer by changing the model, as Meyer would say. Maybe the assumption he made about the nature of academia and newsrooms are wrong. Let's look at what goes well in the interactions between the two. When a university publishes a press release which is then taken up by thousands of media outlets without any substantial modification, the process is well-oiled and efficient. The university (sometimes the individual academic) wants exposure for the paper that was just published (or just written) and the newsroom is happy to receive content that cost nothing to produce and that is widely shared among readers.

When a university publishes a press release explaining that a single brand of chocolate drink helps recover from concussion, many newsrooms are happy to spread the word (research does not back that fact, by the way).<sup><a name='note_10' id='#note_10' class='note_anchor' href='#foot_10'>10</a></sup> Because the chocolate drink example already made the rounds last year, I set out to look for another one. It took me approximately fifteen seconds to browse through the "Science" section of a major French news magazine to find an article on a yet-to-be-published piece of research by two statisticians who make grandiloquent claims in biology (men cannot live more than 114.1 years, they contend).<sup><a name='note_11' id='#note_11' class='note_anchor' href='#foot_11'>11</a></sup> Of course, this nonsense spread after the University of Tilburg published a press release.<sup><a name='note_12' id='#note_12' class='note_anchor' href='#foot_12'>12</a></sup>

Maybe, just maybe, we should consider the hypothesis that neither newsrooms nor academia are very much interested in finding the truth. This would explain why they rarely collaborate on truth-finding projects and cheerfully get together when it comes to spreading falsehoods. After all, for all the good vibes European journalists put in their declarations of principles, such as the Munich Declaration of the Duties and Rights of Journalists<sup><a name='note_13' id='#note_13' class='note_anchor' href='#foot_13'>13</a></sup>, where truth comes in first place, I've yet to see newsrooms enforce any of it. In some European countries, egregious cases of falsification will get you fired, but this is by no means the case everywhere.<sup><a name='note_14' id='#note_14' class='note_anchor' href='#foot_14'>14</a></sup> Short of this, smaller cases of lying or republishing lies won't hurt your career as a journalist.

Similarly, the incentives currently in place in academia do little to foster truth-seeking. Instead, researchers who want to succeed professionally need to publish a lot and fulfill grant contracts. Those who do best are the ones who will not hesitate to kill a result if it shows that the assumptions of the organization that funded the project were false. A successful researcher today is a researcher who will not let the truth come in the way of a good funding opportunity.<sup><a name='note_15' id='#note_15' class='note_anchor' href='#foot_15'>15</a></sup>

Few journalists make finding factual truths their main goal and a dwindling number of academics do. Hopefully, the programs of the Volkswagen Stiftung will help these minorities find each other and conduct interesting projects. But we need to review our expectations: As long as the incentives to produce and communicate untruths remain in place in academia and in the newsroom, Philip Meyer's vision of academics and journalists working hand in hand will remain a mirage.
